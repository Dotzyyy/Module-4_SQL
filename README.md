## python-flask-app w/ postgres sql
Flask Blog 2
Render Url: https://fullstack-python-flask-app.onrender.com/
Github Url: https://github.com/Dotzyyy/Module-4_SQL

## Concept

This app was made to act as an online blog where users can register for an account and sign into the blog. This is an expansion of my previous project
which did not allow actual logins to due to a lack of a database. Connecting the flask app to postgresql we are able to store user information such as username, email, passwords and each of their blogposts.

### Features



* Forms are available to help register, login, edit information and make blog posts on the site.

* A navbar that shrinks into a 'hamburger' when seen on smaller screens.

* An explore page which allows users to view all posts made, not just their own or those of their followers.

* A task list is available so that the user can creat their own 'to-do' list.
